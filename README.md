# Plant-It

A project made as a submission for [Tri-NIT Hackathon](https://unstop.com/hackathons/the-tri-nit-hackathon-national-institute-of-technology-nit-trichy-594092). 

## Problem Statement :

Build a one-stop solution for all gardening aspirations and the country’s farmers.
The government of India sends millions of dollars to provide schemes and educate the
country's farmers. Still, these reach only a handful of them, and most still need to be
used. Similarly, many nature enthusiasts want to start gardening in many metropolitan
cities but need more experience. Like most farmers, they don’t know what plants best
suit their current geolocation and climate. We intend to provide a solution for everyone
interested in getting to know plants.

### Objectives :

1. For Farmers
- Create a central platform that connects farmers from all over India with the latest advancements in agricultural technology.
- Utilise GPS location to suggest crops for farmers to grow based on their specific field and family information.
- Provide information on available schemes and programs from the central and state governments.
- Educate farmers on various hybrid farming methods and technology.
- Include a chat system for farmers to communicate with each other and with experts in the field.

2. For Enthusiasts

- Build an application that helps you track all your plants and their requirements to provide regular notifications and remind you of the same.
- All users should be able to view previously asked plant-specific questions.
- Users should be able to ask plant-specific questions that the expert community can answer on the application.
- Users should be able to share their plant’s progress through pictures/text with the gardening community.

### Features :
- Build a unified platform for people to share their agricultural innovations.
- Users should be able to find all the specifications on how to grow any crop/plant.
- Users can browse plant-specific questions.
- Recommend the best plants to grow based on the user's geolocation and climate.
- Make farmers aware of the new policies put forward by the government.

### Brownie Points :
- Add multi-language support to your website or application.
- Allow users to ask plant/crop-specific questions to experts one-on-one via chat or video call.
- Allow communities to send financial aid to farmers directly.

## Installation : 

- Install the apk file in the root of the repo (app_release.apk) given and you're good to go !!

## Limitations : 

- Requests for Weather and geolocation API's are limited (upto 1000-3000 requests/day).

## Tech-Stack used :

- Flutter as frontend framwork for multi-platform support and for developing application which would be easily accessible by Farmers and Enthusiasts.
- Django as high-level framework for backend as it supports creation of varying API's depending upon need.
- DigitalOcean as hosting platform to deploy.
